# Rules

## Overview

Each player is a rival thief at a gala, racing to fill their **vault** (mint tin) with loot. Bluff, deduce, and outwit your friendsâ€”the first to reach the target loot wins!

## Setup

1. **Each player** takes a mint tin, 6 meeples, and 6 loot tokens.
2. **Central Vault:** Place all loot tokens in a central pile.
3. **Action Cards:** Shuffle the deck, deal 3 per player.
4. **Keep vaults closed** except when adding/removing loot.

## Objective

Be the **first to collect 7 loot** and declare victory, or have the most loot when the central vault is empty.

## Game Flow

1. **Plan:** Each player secretly chooses an Action Card.
2. **Reveal:** All reveal at once, resolving in card order.
3. **Act:** Carry out actions. If two players steal the same loot, roll off.
4. **Draw:** Draw back up to 3 cards.
5. **Repeat** until someone wins!

## Winning

- **Declare victory** after a round if you have 7+ loot. If true, you win. If not, you're out and your loot returns to the vault.
- If the vault runs out, all reveal and the highest loot wins.

See [Action Cards](action-cards.html) for full card details.
