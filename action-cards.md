| 1 | **Guard**    | Protect your vault. Anyone who tries to Pickpocket you fails and loses 1 loot to the vault.         |
| 2 | **Steal**    | Attempt to take 1 loot from the central vault (secretly add to your tin).                       |
| 3 | **Pickpocket** | Attempt to take 1 loot from another player (choose after reveal). If they played Guard/Bluff, you fail. |
| 4 | **Swap**     | Privately exchange 1 loot with another player.                                                  |
| 5 | **Peek**     | Look at another player's loot count (they show you inside their tin).                           |
| 6 | **Double Steal** | Try to take 2 loot from vault. If you fail, lose 1 loot to the vault.                       |
| 7 | **Heist**    | If exactly two players play Heist, both take 1 loot from vault. Otherwise, fail.                |

|11 | **Hide**     | Skip your turn; you cannot be targeted this round.                                              |
|12 | **Boast**    | Secretly announce to one player how many loot you claim to have. If they call bluff and you're lying, lose 1 loot; if true, they lose 1 loot. |
|13 | **Reveal**   | Force all players to show everyone their loot count.                                            |
